API 

This is a content management API built using Node.js, Express, and MongoDB. It provides functionality for user authentication, content creation, and content updates.

Features:

User Signup: Users can sign up by providing their email and password.
User Login: Registered users can log in to the system and receive a JSON Web Token (JWT) for authentication.
Change Password: Authenticated users can change their password.
Add Content: Authenticated users can add new content, specifying the type, title, and content.
Update Content: Authenticated users can update the title and content of their existing content.


Technologies Used:

Node.js
Express
MongoDB
Mongoose
JSON Web Token (JWT)
Express Validator
Prerequisites
Node.js installed on your machine
MongoDB server running locally or remotely

Security Considerations:

- Password Storage: In this implementation, the passwords are stored in plain text. In a production environment, you should implement password hashing and salting for better security.
- JWT Secret Key: The JWT secret key used for token generation should be kept secure and not hardcoded in the application.
- HTTPS: It is recommended to use HTTPS for all API calls to ensure secure communication between the client and the server.
- Rate Limiting: Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse and protect the API from brute-force attacks.
- Input Validation: Validate all user input to prevent SQL injection and other types of attacks.


Future Improvements:

- User Roles and Permissions: Implement a role-based access control system to manage user permissions and restrict access to certain content or actions.
- Content Categories: Add support for content categorization, allowing users to organize their content more effectively.
- Content Search and Filtering: Implement search and filtering functionality to enable users to find specific content more easily.
- Content Versioning: Introduce a versioning system to keep track of changes made to content over time.
- Deployment and Hosting: Package the application and deploy it to a hosting platform, such as Heroku, AWS, or DigitalOcean, to make it accessible to users.
